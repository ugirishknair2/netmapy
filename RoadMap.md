# Introduction #

The project is just started, so there is not much of a road-map yet. This wiki is a way to keep thoughts and ideas about the project all together.

Some initial thoughts:
  * Port the [drupal-nm](http://code.google.com/p/drupal-nm) project or stuff in it? I am growing a little weary about the prospect of upgrading to [Drupal 7](http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0) and [web2py](http://web2py.com) looks promising.
    * One possibility of moving both projects along is to [build services](https://plus.google.com/u/0/106127420216961772978/posts/X2kt9Pwe4c6).
